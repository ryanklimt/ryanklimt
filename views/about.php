		<h2>Proud of my work</h2>
		<p>My foundation is based solely on my love for and appreciation of the internet. I strongly believe that every website must create a wonderful user experience from start to finish, built with outstanding aesthetic design, beautifully entwined with an elegant, rock solid codebase.</p>
		<p>Put simply, I make websites that I am proud of, thatâ€™s why I get out of bed every day.</p>

			<p>What's up, Dear Reader. I'm Ryan Klimt, a web designer and developer.  As a well-rounded user experience developer, I make sure that system, interfaces, language, and designs are human-friendly, emotive, aesthetically pleasing, clear, on-brand and usable - with a touch of mellow smoothness.</p>
			<p>I am primarily a web developer through the use of html, css, php, javascript, and jQuery to provide users with a responsive web experience.  I am currently working full time at <a href="https://idc-marketing.com" target="_blank">idc marketing</a> and find time on a daily basis to expand my knowledge in the future of the web.</p>
			<p>Each site I develop is built to be search engine friendly, using the latest development principles and techniques.  To find out more about what I can do for you, check out my work <a href="work">here</a>, or get ahold of me by either <a href="mailto:ryanklimt@gmail.com">email</a> or by phone at <b>847 912-2543</b>.</p>
